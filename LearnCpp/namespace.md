std is the namespace used by the C++ standard library. It contains a large number of classes, functions, and other elements that are part of the C++ standard library.

The std namespace is used to group all of these elements together so that they can be easily accessed and used in C++ programs. By using the std namespace, you can refer to standard library elements using a prefix of std::, such as std::cout or std::vector<int>.

For example, the std::cout object is used for outputting data to the console in C++, and the std::vector container is used to store a collection of elements.
