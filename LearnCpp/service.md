A server program is a type of software application that is designed to provide services or resources to other programs or devices on a network. In general, a server program listens for incoming requests from clients and responds to them by providing some kind of service or data.

System servers are server programs that are designed to provide low-level services to other programs or to the operating system itself. These services may include things like file and print sharing, authentication and authorization, network communications, and more. System servers are typically run as background processes on a computer or server, and are designed to run continuously and respond to requests as they come in.

Examples of system servers in the Unix/Linux operating system include:

Apache web server: provides web services, allowing clients to access web pages and web applications over the internet.
SSH server: provides secure shell access to the server, allowing remote access and administration over a secure connection.
FTP server: provides file transfer services, allowing users to upload and download files over the network.
DNS server: provides domain name resolution services, translating domain names to IP addresses and vice versa.
These are just a few examples of the many system servers that may be running on a computer or server. They are an essential part of the infrastructure of many modern computing systems.
