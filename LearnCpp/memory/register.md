In C++, the register keyword is used as a hint to the compiler to suggest that a particular variable should be stored in a register instead of in memory. Registers are a type of high-speed memory located in the CPU, which can be accessed much faster than regular RAM.

By using the register keyword, you are telling the compiler that the variable is likely to be used frequently and that storing it in a register will speed up the program's execution. However, it is important to note that the compiler is not required to follow this suggestion, and in many cases, it may decide to store the variable in memory anyway.

Here is an example of using the register keyword in C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    register int i = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
        // do some calculations here
    }
    cout << "i = " << i << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
